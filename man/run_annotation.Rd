\usage{
run_annotation(
  df,
  gene_column = "gene",
  org.from = "human",
  org.to = "mouse",
  release = "105",
  one.to.many = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame containing gene symbols}

\item{gene_column}{Name of the column containing gene symbols. Default is "gene"}

\item{org.from}{Organism type. Either "human" or "mouse". Default is "human"}

\item{org.to}{Target organism. Either "human" or "mouse". Default is "mouse"}

\item{release}{Ensembl release version to use for annotations. Default is "105"}

\item{one.to.many}{Logical. Default is FALSE to return only unique mappings (one/many to one). If TRUE, returns all possible mouse gene mappings (one to many), including cases where one human gene maps to multiple mouse genes.}
}
\value{
A data frame with additional columns containing functional annotations:
- Pathway information
- Protein-protein interactions
- Gene regulatory relationships
- Other functional annotations from OmniPath
}
\description{
Adds functional annotations to a data frame containing gene symbols using pre-computed
OmniPath annotations. The function supports both human and mouse gene symbols.
